# P2_Food_Safety_Datasets🍽️🔍🦠
Use-inspired Framework for AI for Food Safety across the Supply Chain

## Overview📊
FoodDatasets is a digital platform that aims to facilitate the dissemination of datasets that 
can help resolve various domain-specific issues in the realm of food safety. The purpose of data 
sharing is to provide publicly available and meticulously curated datasets for (1) developing new AI 
algorithms with enhanced performance, (2) merging similar datasets to form a more comprehensive dataset, 
and (3) facilitating transfer learning. 

## Usage🛠️
The platform is hosted on the GitHub organization page at https://github.com/FoodDatasets.
Each repository represents a dataset with detailed information on the project context, metadata, and instructions on installation
and running the codes. Please refer to the README file in each repository shown in the following links for specific usage instructions.<br>
